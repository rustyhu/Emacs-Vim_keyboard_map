Emacs-Vim_keyboard_map
================

## Purpose 

When I started to learn and use Emacs and vim, I found the default keyboard map with default keybinds was painful for heavy typing. So I began to look for ideas about comfortable map, and design something like this finally...

## Main Idea

|Initial Key|Binded Key|
|-----------|----------|
|Caps Lock	|Esc	   |
|Esc        |Caps Lock |
|Alt_L		|Ctrl_L	   |
|Win_L		|Alt_L	   |
|Ctrl_L		|Win_L	   |


## Others
This Windows version configuration is tested by myself in MS Windows7.
And Linux version configuration is tested in Arch Linux with xfce4 DE.
More tests are going to be done later.

## Acknowledgement

This map configuration in Windows is in regedit file format, which is generated by a no-fee software KeybMap V1.7.3 refer to following URL:
