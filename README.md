Emacs-Vim_keyboard_map
================

## Purpose 
when I started to learn and use Emacs and vim, I found the default keyboard map with default keybinds was painful for heavy typing. So I began to look for ideas about comfortable map, and design something like this finally...

## Main Idea

|Initial Key|Binded Key|
|-----------|----------|
|Caps Lock	|Esc	   |
|Esc        |Caps Lock |
|Alt_L		|Ctrl_L	   |
|Win_L		|Alt_L	   |
|Ctrl_L		|Win_L	   |


## Others


There is only MS Win version, I do not figure out how to implement in Linux now :(
This map configuration is in form of reg file, which is exported by a no-fee software KeybMap V1.7.3 refer to following URL:
